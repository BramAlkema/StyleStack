**Moved to backlog:**
- Google Slides Template Converter  
- Google Workspace Publishing
- Apps Script add-in development
- Cross-platform token synchronization

**Prerequisites for future consideration:**
- Stable commercial customer base via GitHub licensing
- Market validation of GitHub-native approach
- Customer demand for Google Workspace integration

## Technical Architecture Decisions

### Build vs Buy Decisions

**Build (Custom):**
- OOXML processing (core IP)
- Design token resolution engine
- Template generation pipeline
- Office add-in framework

**Buy/Integrate (SaaS services):**
- User authentication (GitHub native)
- Payment processing (Stripe)
- Email delivery (SendGrid)
- Analytics (GitHub native + Mixpanel)
- Hosting/CDN (GitHub Pages + CDN)

### Technology Stack

**Backend API:**
- Python FastAPI for token management
- PostgreSQL for customer/subscription data
- Redis for caching and session management
- Celery for background template generation

**Frontend Dashboard:**
- Next.js React application
- Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development
- TypeScript for reliability

**Infrastructure:**
- Docker containers for consistent deployment
- AWS/Digital Ocean for hosting
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Monitoring with DataDog or similar

## Risk Mitigation & Validation

### Technical Risks

**Risk:** Office add-in approval process delays launch
**Mitigation:** Build direct download version first, add-in as enhancement

**Risk:** Google Workspace integration complexity
**Mitigation:** Start with manual conversion, automate incrementally

**Risk:** Performance issues with large enterprise customers
**Mitigation:** Load testing with synthetic data, gradual rollout

### Business Risks

**Risk:** Market not ready for design token automation
**Mitigation:** Direct customer development, validate pain points early

**Risk:** Microsoft/Google builds competing features
**Mitigation:** Focus on speed to market, build switching costs through integration

**Risk:** Enterprise sales cycle too long
**Mitigation:** Start with mid-market, build up case studies and references
