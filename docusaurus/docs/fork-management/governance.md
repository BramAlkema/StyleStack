      - "assets/*"
      - "color adjustments <10% change"
      - "spacing modifications"
    approvers:
      required: 1
      pool: ["brand-manager", "design-lead"]
    timeline: "2 business days"
```

#### Class 2: Standard Changes

jobs:
  classify-change:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    outputs:
      change-class: ${{ steps.classify.outputs.class }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Classify Change
        id: classify
        run: |
          python tools/classify-change.py --pr ${{ github.event.number }} \
            --output-format github
            
  request-approval:
    needs: classify-change
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Request Brand Approval
        if: contains(github.event.pull_request.changed_files, 'patches.yaml')
        uses: ./.github/actions/request-approval
        with:
          approver-team: 'brand-managers'
          change-class: ${{ needs.classify-change.outputs.change-class }}
          
      - name: Request Compliance Approval  
        if: contains(github.event.pull_request.labels.*.name, 'compliance')
        uses: ./.github/actions/request-approval
        with:
          approver-team: 'compliance-officers'
```

#### Slack Integration

```python

    def request_approval(self, pr_number, approvers, change_class):
        pr = self.github.get_repo("your-org/stylestack-your-org").get_pull(pr_number)
        
        message = f"""
