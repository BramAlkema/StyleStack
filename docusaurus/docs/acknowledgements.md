# Acknowledgements

StyleStack wouldn't exist without the incredible platforms, technologies, and communities that make modern software development possible.

## üöÄ GitHub - The Platform That Changed Everything

**Massive thanks to GitHub** for creating the most revolutionary software development platform in history. StyleStack's entire licensing and distribution system is built on GitHub's incredible infrastructure:

### GitHub Actions - The Game Changer
GitHub Actions didn't just give us CI/CD - it gave us a **distributed computing platform** that makes the impossible possible. Our entire licensing system runs on Actions because:

- **OIDC Tokens** - Cryptographically secure identity verification that can't be spoofed
- **Repository Dispatch** - Cross-repository communication that enables our license distribution
- **Secrets Management** - Enterprise-grade security for sensitive license data
- **Global Infrastructure** - 99.95% uptime SLA that our customers depend on

### Why GitHub's Vision Matters

GitHub didn't just build a git hosting service - they built **the backbone of modern software**. By making advanced features like OIDC, Actions, and Packages available to everyone, GitHub democratized capabilities that previously required massive infrastructure investments.

**StyleStack exists because GitHub made it possible** to build enterprise-grade licensing without running a single server. This is the future of software - distributed, secure, and accessible to everyone.

### GitHub Features That Power StyleStack

- üîê **OIDC Identity Provider** - Impossible-to-forge identity verification
- ‚ö° **GitHub Actions** - Zero-maintenance compute platform
- üì¶ **Repository Secrets** - Secure credential management
- üåê **Repository Dispatch** - Real-time cross-repo communication
- üìä **Issues & Discussions** - Built-in customer support platform
- üîÑ **Git Infrastructure** - Rock-solid version control and collaboration
- üåç **Global CDN** - Instant worldwide distribution of templates

*Thank you, GitHub, for building the platform that makes StyleStack's vision of "Design Tokens as a Service" not just possible, but inevitable.*
