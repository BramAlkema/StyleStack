# Welcome to StyleStack Documentation

StyleStack is an **OOXML-native build system** that provides layered, community-driven Office template defaults, replacing Microsoft's outdated 1995 styling with modern, accessible, and professionally designed templates.

## Why StyleStack?

Organizations worldwide struggle with:
- 🎨 **Inconsistent branding** across Office documents
- ♿ **Accessibility compliance** requirements
- 🌍 **Multi-language support** complexity
- 🔄 **Template maintenance** overhead
- 📊 **Design token management** across platforms

StyleStack solves these problems through a **fork-first distribution model** where institutions can:
1. Fork the entire project
2. Customize design tokens for their brand
3. Deploy templates organization-wide
4. Stay synchronized with upstream improvements

## Who Uses StyleStack?

## Core Concepts

### Three-Layer System
```
Core (Community) → Organization → User
```

1. **Core Layer**: Community-maintained baseline defaults
2. **Organization Layer**: Your institutional customizations
3. **User Layer**: Personal preferences (optional)

### Design Tokens
Variables that define your visual design system:
- Colors, fonts, spacing
- Logos and brand assets
- Accessibility parameters
- Layout configurations

### Fork-First Distribution
Instead of using pre-built templates, organizations:
- Fork the entire StyleStack repository

- Deploy internally
- Sync with upstream updates
