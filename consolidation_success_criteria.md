## Success Criteria Framework

### 🎯 PRIMARY SUCCESS METRICS

#### 1. File Reduction Targets

- **Stretch Target**: 35% file reduction (111 → 72 files)
- **Measurement**: Actual file count after consolidation vs baseline

#### 2. Test Coverage Preservation  
- **Requirement**: 100% test coverage preservation (zero tolerance for regression)
- **Measurement**: Coverage analysis before/after showing identical function/line coverage
- **Validation**: All 1,783 test cases must continue to pass

#### 3. Performance Improvement
- **Primary Target**: 30-50% faster CI execution time
- **Baseline**: Current ~14 minutes full test execution
- **Target Range**: 7-10 minutes post-consolidation
- **Measurement**: CI pipeline execution time comparison

#### 4. Quality Improvement
- **Collection Errors**: Reduce from 10 files to 0 files with syntax/import issues
- **Test Discovery**: Improve from 0.77s to <0.5s collection time
- **Maintainability**: Single authoritative test file per module pattern
