# Import Issues Systematic Repair Tasks

These are the tasks to systematically fix the 18 broken imports across 6 files that are blocking the comprehensive test suite recovery.

> Created: 2025-09-10
> Status: Ready for Implementation
> Objective: Recover test coverage from 6.91% to 85-90% by fixing broken imports

## Tasks

- [ ] **1. Quick Wins - Individual File Fixes (Low Risk)**
  - [ ] 1.1 Write/verify import validation tests for isolated modules
  - [ ] 1.2 Fix `tools/concurrent_processing_validator.py` - add `tools.` prefix to advanced_cache_system import
  - [ ] 1.3 Fix `tools/production_monitoring.py` - add `tools.` prefix to advanced_cache_system import  
  - [ ] 1.4 Test individual module imports with `python -c "from tools.[module] import *"`
  - [ ] 1.5 Run limited test suite to ensure coverage stays ≥ 6.91%
  - [ ] 1.6 Verify no new import cycles introduced
  - [ ] 1.7 Run `pytest --collect-only` to check for new import errors
  - [ ] 1.8 Verify all isolated module fixes are working correctly

- [ ] **2. Typing Dependencies - Missing Import Additions (Low Risk)**
  - [ ] 2.1 Write/verify typing validation tests for NamedTuple usage
  - [ ] 2.2 Fix `tools/production_load_testing.py` - add `NamedTuple` to typing imports
  - [ ] 2.3 Fix `tools/optimized_batch_processor.py` - add `NamedTuple` to typing imports
  - [ ] 2.4 Test each file's typing imports individually 
  - [ ] 2.5 Verify NamedTuple classes can be instantiated correctly
  - [ ] 2.6 Run static type checking if available (mypy/pylint)
  - [ ] 2.7 Ensure no typing-related import errors remain
  - [ ] 2.8 Verify all typing dependencies are correctly resolved

- [ ] **3. Production Module Cluster - High-Impact Fixes (Medium Risk)**
  - [ ] 3.1 Write/verify integration tests for production module interactions
  - [ ] 3.2 Fix `tools/production_load_testing.py` - add `tools.` prefix to 4 imports (performance_profiler, optimized_batch_processor, performance_benchmarks, production_monitoring)
  - [ ] 3.3 Fix `tools/optimized_batch_processor.py` - add `tools.` prefix to 3 imports (memory_optimizer, advanced_cache_system, performance_profiler)
  - [ ] 3.4 Fix `tools/optimization_validation_tests.py` - add `tools.` prefix to 5 imports (advanced_cache_system, memory_optimizer, optimized_batch_processor, concurrent_processing_validator, production_monitoring)
  - [ ] 3.5 Test production module cluster imports sequentially
  - [ ] 3.6 Verify cross-module dependencies resolve correctly
  - [ ] 3.7 Run performance-related tests to ensure functionality preserved
  - [ ] 3.8 Verify all production modules can be imported successfully

- [ ] **4. Comprehensive System Validation (Medium Risk)**
  - [ ] 4.1 Write/verify comprehensive test coverage validation scripts
  - [ ] 4.2 Run complete `pytest --collect-only` with zero import errors
  - [ ] 4.3 Execute full test suite and measure coverage improvement
  - [ ] 4.4 Verify coverage recovery target: from 6.91% to ≥ 20% (significant improvement goal)
  - [ ] 4.5 Test build integration processes that were previously working
  - [ ] 4.6 Validate that all 60 test files can collect successfully
  - [ ] 4.7 Run memory and performance regression tests
  - [ ] 4.8 Verify all import fixes are working in production environment

- [ ] **5. Rollback Strategy Preparation and Documentation (High Priority)**
  - [ ] 5.1 Document current working state before starting fixes (git commit hash, coverage metrics)
  - [ ] 5.2 Create individual file rollback commands for each fix attempt
  - [ ] 5.3 Prepare batch rollback strategy for production module cluster
  - [ ] 5.4 Set up comprehensive rollback (nuclear option) with re-application of critical fixes
  - [ ] 5.5 Test rollback procedures on a separate branch
  - [ ] 5.6 Create validation checklist for post-rollback state verification
  - [ ] 5.7 Document success criteria and failure thresholds for each task
  - [ ] 5.8 Verify all rollback strategies work correctly

## Implementation Strategy

**Incremental Approach:**
- Fix one module at a time with immediate testing
- Preserve the working 6.91% baseline throughout
- Use validated fix pattern: add missing typing imports + tools. prefix
- Test each fix independently before proceeding

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Low risk tasks first (isolated modules)
- Medium risk tasks with complex dependencies last
- Immediate rollback capability for each step
- Coverage monitoring to prevent regression

**Technical Dependencies:**
1. Tasks 1-2 can run in parallel (independent modules)
2. Task 3 depends on Tasks 1-2 completion (interconnected production modules)
3. Task 4 requires all import fixes completed
4. Task 5 runs continuously (rollback preparation)

**Success Criteria:**
- **Must Have**: All 18 broken imports fixed, coverage ≥ 6.91%, no new import errors
- **Should Have**: Coverage ≥ 20%, all production modules importable
- **Nice to Have**: Coverage ≥ 85%, full comprehensive test suite operational

**Validation Commands:**
```bash
# Per-module validation
python -c "from tools.[module] import *; print('✅ Import successful')"

# System-wide validation  
pytest --collect-only  # Should show zero import errors
pytest --cov=. --cov-report=term-missing  # Coverage measurement
```
