## Development Approach

**Test-Driven Development Focus:**
- Each major task begins with test writing
- All tasks end with verification step
- Build incrementally toward MVP launch
- Consider technical dependencies between tasks

**Priority Order:**
1. **Stabilization** (Tasks 1-2): Foundation must be solid
2. **MVP Features** (Task 3): Market validation capabilities  
3. **Multi-Platform** (Task 4): Phase 5 roadmap preparation
4. **Documentation** (Task 5): Developer and user experience

**Success Criteria:**
- All tests passing with >95% success rate
- Production-ready build system
- MVP ready for initial customer validation
- Foundation prepared for multi-platform expansion
