# Product Mission

## Pitch

StyleStack is a design token-driven OOXML build system that helps developers, designers, and IT admins create consistent, accessible Office templates through a Material Web-inspired token architecture that ensures cross-platform design system consistency.

## Users

### Primary Customers

- **Development Teams**: Organizations that want versionable, auditable Office template infrastructure
- **IT Administrators**: Teams responsible for distributing and maintaining corporate Office templates across organizations
- **Design Teams**: Creative professionals fighting against Office's default styling limitations
- **Enterprise Organizations**: Companies needing branded, consistent templates across PowerPoint, Word, and Excel

### User Personas

**DevOps Engineer** (28-45 years old)
- **Role:** Infrastructure Engineer / Platform Engineer
- **Context:** Manages corporate tooling and standardization across development and business teams
- **Pain Points:** Manual template distribution, no version control for Office assets, inconsistent branding across teams
- **Goals:** Automate template deployment, maintain consistency, track template usage and updates

**Corporate Designer** (25-40 years old)
- **Role:** Brand Manager / UX Designer / Marketing Designer
- **Context:** Responsible for maintaining brand consistency across all company materials including presentations and documents
- **Pain Points:** Office defaults override brand guidelines, manual template creation, no way to enforce design standards
- **Goals:** Implement brand guidelines in templates, ensure accessibility compliance, streamline design-to-template workflow

**IT Administrator** (30-50 years old)
- **Role:** IT Manager / Systems Administrator
- **Context:** Manages Office 365 deployment and corporate software distribution
- **Pain Points:** Broken .potx/.dotx/.xltx files, manual template updates, users reverting to ugly defaults
- **Goals:** Reliable template distribution, automatic updates, minimal support tickets about formatting

## The Problem

### Outdated Office Defaults

Every time users open PowerPoint, Word, or Excel, they encounter the same 1995 defaults: inconsistent fonts, ugly bullets, random placeholder grids, and garish colors. These defaults fail modern accessibility standards and create inconsistent, unprofessional documents.

**Our Solution:** Provide community-maintained "better defaults" with modern typography, accessible color schemes, and professional layouts.

### Template Distribution Chaos

Each company reinvents the wheel by creating their own broken .potx/.dotx/.xltx files with no version control, no testing, and no systematic approach to updates. IT admins distribute templates manually, designers curse the limitations, and users fall back to ugly defaults.

**Our Solution:** Build automation and patch-based system for reproducible, testable template generation with CI/CD integration.

### No Template Infrastructure

Unlike code, Office templates have no ecosystem for sharing improvements, no way to fork and contribute back, and no systematic approach to customization that preserves upstream improvements.

**Our Solution:** Git-based template infrastructure with community core, organizational layers, and user customization that maintains compatibility.

## Differentiators

### Design Token Architecture

Unlike traditional template tools that hardcode styling values, StyleStack uses a Material Web-inspired design token system where all styling references tokens, never raw values. This creates a single source of truth for colors, typography, and spacing that automatically cascades across PowerPoint, Word, and Excel templates.

### Layered Customization System

Unlike monolithic template solutions, StyleStack implements a three-layer system (Core → Org → User) where community improvements automatically flow downstream while preserving organizational branding and personal preferences. This prevents fragmentation while enabling customization.

### Developer-First Approach

Unlike GUI-based template tools, StyleStack treats templates as code with CLI builds (`python build.py --org acme --channel present`), CI/CD validation, automated testing for accessibility and style compliance, and semantic versioning. This enables DevOps practices for Office infrastructure.

## Key Features

### Core Features

- **Community-Maintained Baseline:** Professional defaults for typography (Inter/Noto), color schemes (WCAG AA compliant), and layouts replacing Microsoft's 1995 styling
- **OOXML Build System:** Python-based CLI that generates .potx/.dotx/.xltx from declarative YAML patches and raw OOXML components
- **Three-Layer Architecture:** Core community defaults + organizational branding + personal customization with deterministic merging
- **Multi-Product Support:** Unified styling across PowerPoint presentations, Word documents, and Excel spreadsheets

### Automation Features

- **CI/CD Integration:** GitHub Actions automatically build, validate, and test template combinations with accessibility checking and style linting
- **Semantic Versioning:** Track every color hex, font choice, and layout change with Git-based version control and automated release management
- **Quality Validation:** Automated banning of tacky effects (3D shadows, bevels), contrast ratio checking, and OOXML structure validation
- **Artifact Signing:** Cryptographically signed template releases with checksum verification for enterprise security

### Distribution Features

- **Optional Office Add-in:** JavaScript-based add-in for automatic template updates, version checking, and corporate deployment
- **Release Automation:** GitHub Releases automatically publish signed templates with naming convention (BetterDefaults-acme-present-1.3.0.potx)
- **Fork-Friendly Governance:** Downstream organizations can fork and overlay branding without polluting upstream community improvements
